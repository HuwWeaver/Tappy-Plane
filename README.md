# Tappy-Plane

---- ABOUT ----
Just a simple endless game similar to Flappy Bird - dodge the obstacles, collect the stars, and see how far you can get!
A game made to get me back into the swing of programming and game dev after a bit of a career break. 

Raylib required to compile code, download here: https://www.raylib.com

---- Instructions ----
Use Space Bar to jump the plane upwards.
Use R to restart the game after a Game Over.
